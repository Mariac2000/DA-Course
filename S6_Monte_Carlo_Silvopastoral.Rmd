## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
num_simulations <- 10000
num_simulations <- 10000
apple_income_range <- c(30000, 60000)
apple_costs_range <- c(15000, 30000)
apple_income <- runif(n = num_simulations, min = apple_income_range[1], max = apple_income_range[2])
apple_income
apple_costs <- runif(n = num_simulations, min = apple_costs_range[1], max = apple_costs_range[2])
summary(apple_costs)
summary(apple_income)
apple_profits <- apple_income - apple_costs
summary(apple_profits)
hist(apple_profits)
# abline(v=quantile(apple_profits,
#                   c(0.1,0.5,0.9),

sheep_income <- runif(n= num_simulations, min = 2000, max = 5000)
sheep_costs <- runif(n= num_simulations, min = 1000, max= 3000)
sheep_results <- sheep_income - sheep_costs
summary(sheep_results)
sheep_profts <- sheep_income - sheep_costs
total_profits <- apple_profits + sheep_profts
summary(total_profits)
hist(apple_profits)
hist(apple_profits,
     xlab = "Profits in â‚¬",     # X-axis label
     ylab = "Frequency",       # Y-axis label
     main = "Total Results")
hist(sheep_profts, add = TRUE)
total_results <- apple_profits + sheep_profts
hist(total_results, add = TRUE, col = "violet")
```
